<h2> Can we use numerous global and country-specific factors to predict the number of fatalities during war-time events?</h2>

Wars are unfortuantely a rather prevalent part of human history, and as technology advances, so too does the probability of fatalities. However, the hostility of countries involved might not be intrinsic to their leadership, and may instead be a result of internal and global factors. Countries in the midst of economic decline or those suffering from a global recession may ultimately take on more risk and bloodshed for the hopes of better gains. Moreover, a country with high rates of homicide could well have leadership who are more indifferent to violence externally. Our project seeks to understand the relationship between violent crime rates, global economic factors, and the outcomes of battles in terms of fatalities.
